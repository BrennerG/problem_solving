# Vertex Covers using Simulated Annealing

# How to

Exectue all files from data directory with all available settings:

```
python3 main.py
```

Execute specific file with passed settings from args:

```
python3 main.py vc-exact_019.gr 60000 1 1
python3 main.py <file_name> <runtime in ms> <max_temperature> <seed>
```

# Randomly Generated Neighbourhood
Each Neighbour generated by flipping 1 Node

# Evalution / Cost
if not valid: 0
if valid: # nodes

# Cooling Rate g(Temperature, time)
use actual program runtime to define cooling rate
ideally T goes towards 0 @ last point in time
example: T = old_T * 0.98

# Termination Criterion
1 Minute Runtime
