# Vertex Covers using Simulated Annealing

# Randomly Generated Neighbourhood
Each Neighbour generated by flipping 1 Node

# Evalution / Cost
if not valid: 0
if valid: # nodes 

# Cooling Rate g(Temperature, time)
use actual program runtime to define cooling rate
ideally T goes towards 0 @ last point in time
example: T = old_T * 0.98

# Termination Criterion
1 Minute Runtime
